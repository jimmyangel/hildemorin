body: "When I received your email about the show in Hood River, we made arrangements and went!  It was well worth it.  I especially loved the winter triptych.  \r\nI really enjoyed seeing the process pictures above.  I keep trying to take your class in Asilomar...either the dates dont work or the class is filled!  Will just keep trying.\r\nI am sorry to hear that your mother has passed away.  And glad she had a long life that looks like it was filled with good things including a very talented daughter."
