  So sorry to hear that your mom passed away. Her drawings were beautiful. How
  hard it must have been to be in school during the war. What a beautiful and
  creative daughter she raised; I can tell her heart from my time spent with you
  and seeing your art. Her spirit lives within you, and your memory of her keeps
  her alive with you always.  Much love to you.
