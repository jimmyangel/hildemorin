  Oh Hilde--what a blow to lose your mother, at any age. She must have had an
  interesting and full life. It's sad that you were both so far apart. Well,
  mothers and daughters are still in each other's hearts, no matter the
  distance. Her designs are lovely--that back view of an evening dress cut down
  to there! The red coat, hat, and handbag remind me of current designs in the
  Marfy catalogue. Tres chic. And....I love your new piece and so appreciate
  seeing it take shape. Stunning!
