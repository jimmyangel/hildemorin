  Your work is amazing Hilde, I have some photographs that I took in Toulouse,
  France a number of years ago that resemble your street.  Your mothers work is
  also amazing, I love that era. My mother was a seamstress and made patterns
  from newsprint, wish I had some them today.  So sorry for the passing of your
  mother.
