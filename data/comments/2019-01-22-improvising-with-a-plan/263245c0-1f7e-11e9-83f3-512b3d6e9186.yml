  Hilde, thank you so much for sharing both your process for this piece and your
  photo of the finished piece itself, which is absolutely fabulous.   I love
  everything about it, i.e., the color choices, the angular structures, and the
  quilting.    And your mother's work is beautiful.  I am so sorry for your
  loss.  My mother died about 10 years ago (also in January) at the age of 96. 
  She is always in my heart.  I know it will be the same for you.  Your mother
  must have been so very proud of your extraordinary talent.   I hope to be able
  to take another workshop with you soon.   You continue to inspire me in every
  way.   Very best, Carole
