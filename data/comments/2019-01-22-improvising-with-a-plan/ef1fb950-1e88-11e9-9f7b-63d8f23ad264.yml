body: "Your new work is stunning Hilde!  I love the graphic nature and abstraction of the street scapes in Europe...  Beautiful! \r\nLast but not least, you carry on your mother's love of design and fiber and her legacy will continue with all you create!  Just like your mom, you too are an optimist and that is one of many attributes I love about you....."
