body: "What wonderful inspiration you provide!  I would love to take another class from you!  Brooke and I are attending Asilomar this year but don’t think it’s during a week you teach (Gloria Loughman).   Love what you shared regarding your mother ...warm thoughts your way as you deal with your loss \U0001F497. Your  new piece looks like it has a number 1 above the blue door on the right side ...you could title this piece “Behind Door Number One”."
