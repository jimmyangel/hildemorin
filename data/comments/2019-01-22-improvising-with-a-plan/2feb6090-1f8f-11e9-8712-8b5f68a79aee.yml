body: "What a lovely tribute to your mom Hilde, her designs are timeless and so nice for you to have these to admire. You obviously have the same love of textiles and design, she must have been an important influence to you. My condolences on your mom’s passing.\r\n\r\nI love your new work of art and can see why street scenes from France inspired you. I’ve always been a fan of architecture which is why I’ve been drawn to your art. I look forward to seeing this one in person one day..."
