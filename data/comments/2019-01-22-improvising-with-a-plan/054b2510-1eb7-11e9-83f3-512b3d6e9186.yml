body: "I have lovely memories of you telling us of the packages you sent to your mother in Venezuela, to comfort her with food and other treats that weren't available in the crisis there.  That you always had her in your heart and your actions probably made it possible for her to live to such a great age.  She was a very talented designer of clothing and\r\nher fabric heritage has been left in good hands.  I love your current work and it encourages me to keep in my own studio, where I continue to lapse into working on my lap!"
