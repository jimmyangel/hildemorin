  Thank you for such an inspiring post, Hilde.  I have had the opportunity to
  take your class at Sister's and it was a wonderful experience.  You are a
  knowledgeable to patient teacher.  During the class we talked about our mutual
  connections to Venezuela.  Your mother's fashion designs are amazing.  I am
  sure you have been inspired by her in many ways.  I am sorry for your loss. 
  Take care, Hilde.
