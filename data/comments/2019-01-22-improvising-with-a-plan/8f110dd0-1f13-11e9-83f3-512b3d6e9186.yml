  I was so glad to see your blog in my mailbox this morning. I've missed you.
  Your blog's walk-through for this street scene is fabulous — can't wait to
  play with a photo I took of a street scene on the island of Santorini (many
  years ago), keeping you as my spirit guide as I go. Very sorry to hear about
  your mother . She lived a long life and, from what you say of her and show of
  her work, she lived a good one. My own mother will be 96 in April; since she
  had a stroke two years ago, I care for her from a distance — she lives in  a
  nursing home in Southern California and I live in Northern California near
  Santa Cruz.. My husband and I travel to see her every month or two months. It
  is our time in life to contemplate the meaning of all our close relationships
  and bless them, for good and bad, for they are our teachers too. Sending you
  aloha, Hilde. Continue on making your gorgeous art.
