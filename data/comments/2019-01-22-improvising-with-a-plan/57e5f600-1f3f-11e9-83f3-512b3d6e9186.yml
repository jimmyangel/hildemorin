  My thoughts are with you.  Your mother was a very talented designer as are
  you.  My mom was also a seamstress and passed at 92, I miss her every day but
  get to use her sewing machine from the 30's, still running like a charm!  My
  hope is to one day be able to take one of your classes.  I've seen some works
  done by friends who have been able to take your class, absolutely fantastic! 
  Your work is inspirational!  Keep well.
