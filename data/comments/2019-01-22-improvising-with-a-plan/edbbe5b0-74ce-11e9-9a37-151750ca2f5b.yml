  I was stunned that this piece is pieced and not raw edge!  Unbelievable!   I
  can’t wait to see it at Visions this summer and come to your class at Asilomar
  next spring. It will be good to see you again and learn more techniques
  “beyond the bowls” . . . And Although its never easy to say goodbye to your
  mother, you are so blessed to have had such a great teacher and inspiration in
  her presence in your life.  She will never be far from you.
