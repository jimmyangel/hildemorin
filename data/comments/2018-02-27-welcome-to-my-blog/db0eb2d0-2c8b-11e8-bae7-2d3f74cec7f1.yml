body: "How exciting to find you in my mailbox today!  I exist in Chicago, but for a few years I lived in Seattle and a lovely little town called Seaside on the coast up by Astoria.  Fond memories from there.\r\n\r\nI love working with fiber, particularly with a nice, well-written tutorial as you have begun.  I so enjoy pulling fabrics from my stash to begin a new project.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for getting in touch."
