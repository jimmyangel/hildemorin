  Hilde, I'm delighted to hear from you and to have the opportunity to continue
  to do so.  I saw a bowl made in one of your classes recently, and it sparked
  the desire to try and make one.  How serendipitous to receive your email and
  bowl instructions.  I've thoroughly enjoyed the classes I've taken from you
  and hope for more in future!
