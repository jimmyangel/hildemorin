  What a spectacular creation. As others have stated, your planning and design
  process what so very interesting.  Thank you so much...unlikely I will ever be
  capable of such a work of art, but I was fascinated with your process. 
  Additionally, we will be vacationing in Sea Side in a few weeks and will most
  definitely be enjoying seeing it in person. Wow, what a visual treat we are
  looking forward to seeing soon!!!!
