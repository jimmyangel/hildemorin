  Hilde, it's magnificent!  It says a lot that they have chosen to place it at
  the entrance and I think you were very thoughtful in having it be an
  invitation of sorts to step "inside", be it the scene itself or the Center.   
  Thanks for the step by step documentation and for showing all the wonderful
  work on the fabrics before you even got to cutting them into design pieces. 
  Excellent work and something that will be enjoyed by so man people.
