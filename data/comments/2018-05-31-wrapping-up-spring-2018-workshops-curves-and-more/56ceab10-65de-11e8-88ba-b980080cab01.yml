body: "Again, beautiful and evocative quilts. They are like Rorschachs, in the best sense. I see new elements each time I look at them. What a wonderful time you must have had.\r\n\r\nA huckleberry shake--lucky girl! My grandparents used to travel from the Santa Cruz area to near the Oregon border to pick huckleberries. My g-father even devised a scoop to make picking easier. They picked so many they froze them and shared with family."
