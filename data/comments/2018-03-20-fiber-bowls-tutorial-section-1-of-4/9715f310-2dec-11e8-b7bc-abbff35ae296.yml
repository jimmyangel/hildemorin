  Hilde, I have always admired your work! I have been into art quilting a lot
  even if now I have switched to making hoodies for my granddaughter (trying to
  tame my overlock machine working with knits). But I am still tempted to learn
  something new in the field of art - there are so many techniques! I am
  delighted that you have decided to share some of your precious experience and
  expertise! I am looking forward to whatever you show us on your blog!
