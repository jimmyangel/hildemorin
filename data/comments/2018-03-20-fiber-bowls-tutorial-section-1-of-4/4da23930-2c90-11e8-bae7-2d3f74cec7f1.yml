  So very thankful for your blog bowl lessons. Have been wanting to get to one
  of your classes on this for a year. A seemingly on-going sequences of family
  needs from my parents, children, and spouse have had to be prioritized
  instead. Bless you! This gives me something to get going on for myself.
