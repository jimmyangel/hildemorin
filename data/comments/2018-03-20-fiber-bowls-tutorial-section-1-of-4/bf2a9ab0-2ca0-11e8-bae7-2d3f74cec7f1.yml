  Thank you so much! I have dreamed of travelling all the way to the west coast
  from Ontario, Canada to take a class with you. Your work is beautiful and
  inspiring, and I love your use of colour! Thank you for sharing this
  technique.. I am looking forward to making a bowl and maybe one day, I will
  make it out there to take a class with you in person.
