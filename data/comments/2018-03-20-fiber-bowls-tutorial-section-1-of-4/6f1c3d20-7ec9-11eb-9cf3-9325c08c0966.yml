body: "Hello there Hilde.I think your bowls are fabulous and I am following your instructions to make my first bowl.\r\nMy question is, you say to go around the entire bowl in order to get the shape and make the bowl stronger, but when I look at some of your work you appear to have embellished your bowls and then done machine lines over the top to add contours etc. Does this mean you have gone around the bowl first and then covered it again before sewing the different type of lines. Because on some of your work I cannot see the original circle, thatâ€™s if they are there!!\r\nDoes this make sense? I know what I mean but find it difficult to explain, only I would like to try to emulate your work! I mean as a hobby,I am no commercial threat!!!\r\nBest wishes Susie"
