  I am a huge fan of your work, and if I lived anywhere near you, I would sign
  up for your classes, but I live all the way across the country in Virginia
  Beach, Virginia.  I have made my own total machine-stitch fabric vessels using
  a 2 pattern shapes  (mainly cylindrical, but I need to create more of a
  basket,,,so maybe with the rest of the steps, I can accomplish. this.  Also

  advance....
