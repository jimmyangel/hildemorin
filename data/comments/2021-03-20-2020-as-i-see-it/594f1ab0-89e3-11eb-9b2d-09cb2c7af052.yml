  Seeing your creative process and hearing of the thoughts that lead to the
  finished piece is very inspiring, Hilde.  Your 2020 - As I See It quilt piece
  is full of details representing the year and our world/communities and it will
  hang in a place of honor in your home.  I can only imagine how wonderful you
  will feel when you can resume Tuesdays with grandkids and teaching eager
  students again.  Your creativity will be overflowing!!  With much respect and
  admiration, Shelley..
