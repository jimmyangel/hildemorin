  This is such a thoughtful and wonderful quilt. Thank you for your generous
  sharing or your process. After a long period of time out of my studio I seem
  to have returned with renewed energy, maybe spring fever. Also a wonderful
  memory of this stressful time. We will get our shots tomorrow and are planning
  Easter with our children who also had shots, as for our son's family in Europe
  one can hope eventually, Last visit with them was Christmas 2019.
