  Hilde, I love this work.  It really makes me feel the isolation, especially
  your choice of background.  Because of that I find it beautiful but a little
  bit disturbing, but also magical.  Love your buildings and the color in the
  bubbles.  Thank you for sharing.  Would love to take one of your classes with
  buildings!
