  You have captured the theme very well.  2020 has been a year spent in a
  bubble, isolated from everyone else.  Each of your cities is distinct and
  appear to float in a soup of contagion yet tenuously connected by lines of
  various technologies.  As always, thanks for sharing the methodology that went
  in to creating this beautiful piece of art.
