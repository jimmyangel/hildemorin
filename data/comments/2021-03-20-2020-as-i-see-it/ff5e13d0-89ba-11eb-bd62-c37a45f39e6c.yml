  A brilliant quilt representing 2020 Hilde! With each of us in our own bubbles,
  I would have been isolated completely if it weren’t for technology (especially
  Zoom) which has helped me stay connected to friends and family. Online classes
  and quilt shows have been a silver lining enabling me to nurture my creative
  self. Thank you for sharing your creative process, I love every element in
  your design and it’s an absolutely brilliant work of art!
