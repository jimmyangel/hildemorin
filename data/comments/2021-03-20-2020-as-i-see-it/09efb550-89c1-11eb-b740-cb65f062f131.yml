body: "Lovely bubbles, but still I hope they pop soon and we can all join and see more than our own bubble.\r\nFrance had such a different coloring and I am curious on where it will eventually find its home. I will check the website you mentioned in regards of circles out.\r\nAll the best to you, Riccardo and the whole gang. Andrea"
