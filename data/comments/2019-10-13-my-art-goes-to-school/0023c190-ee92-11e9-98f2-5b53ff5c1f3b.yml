  This is stunning, how exciting to be recognized.  Your beautiful art will live
  on through generations of young minds. A what a beautiful location and
  concept.   As a vinyl piece do they still have the feel of the textures you
  create in you pieces?  Congratulations Hilde, you deserve the  recognition
  that will come with this installation for years.
