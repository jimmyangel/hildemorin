body: "It’s exciting news indeed that a public school would seek out art, especially fiber art, for its walls\r\n\r\nwhere the children ( and adults!) can see it every day.  And they did well to choose your beautiful work!  \r\n\r\nThere is so much lovely detail and good design for young minds to absorb. Congratulations!  I’m happy for \r\n\r\nyou and for them."
