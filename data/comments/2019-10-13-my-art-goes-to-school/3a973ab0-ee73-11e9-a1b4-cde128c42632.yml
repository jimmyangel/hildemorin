  Hilde, I loved the placement and colors of the quilts 'that did not make it'.
  They looked great and welcoming!  Anyway, as with all your quilts and bowls,
  the ones that were chosen are outstanding. I am so thankful that I was able to
  take a couple of classes with you in Sisters. You are an outstanding fiber
  artist (AND A GREAT TEACHER).
