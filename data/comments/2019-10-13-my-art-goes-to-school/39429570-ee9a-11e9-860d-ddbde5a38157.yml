  Congrats to you, Hilde!  Your works of art will be something young minds see
  every day.  Your creativity will be instilled in the school children's minds,
  and all who work and visit the school, too.  A wonderful legacy of which you
  will probably never see how it plays out in the lives that go forward from
  Beatrice Morrow Cannady school.  We all affect each other.  Thank you for
  sharing your success and art!
