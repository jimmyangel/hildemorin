  Hello I just found your blog and am excited to try these fiber bowls as I was
  on a Zoom Webinar and there was a fiber bowl in the background of one person
  who said she had taken a class however I didn't pick up a name. One question I
  have is: I have an embroidery machine and was wondering if I could embroidery
  in the bowl? If not I guess I could do it as a patch and iron it in! Wish I
  could be at Sisters Oregon this summer however I will be there in July and
  miss your class, really glad I found your blog!
