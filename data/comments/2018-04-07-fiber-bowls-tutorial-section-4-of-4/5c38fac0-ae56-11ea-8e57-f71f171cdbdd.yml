  Iâ€™m wondering what your thoughts are regarding using regular Wonder Under, the
  stretch variety, or the heavy duty? Do you feel there is an advantage of one
  over another? I could see how the stretch variety may make adding pieces once
  the curves have been sewn in, and the heavy duty may make fusing to canvas
  easier, though perhaps make it more difficult to sew through later? Curious
  what your thoughts are. Thanks!
