body: "I found your work through Pinterest;  it is fabulous, how I wish I lived in the States!  However I am in France.  I am a feltmaker using wools and other fibres to create landscapes.\r\nYour work inspires me and your generosity in sharing your techniques and talents with other textile lovers is greatly admired and appreciated.  Thank you so much."
