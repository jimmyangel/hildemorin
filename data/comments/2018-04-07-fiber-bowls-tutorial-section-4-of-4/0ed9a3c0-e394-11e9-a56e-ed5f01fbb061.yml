body: "This is out of this world. Thank you so much for sharing. Wish I lived in the States to take some of your classes. Maybe somebody will try here in South Africa. But with Christmas not that far away I will try and make a few presents and hope they will come out like yours. (wishful thinking maybe, but I have a go).\r\nIt will be something very special for a good friend of mine who is also a quilter.\r\nWishing you all the best and hope you will have many more of your brilliant ideas.\r\nThanks again Heidi"
