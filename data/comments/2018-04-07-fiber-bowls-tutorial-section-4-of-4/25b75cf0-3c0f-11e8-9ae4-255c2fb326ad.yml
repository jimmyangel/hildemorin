  Your work is so inspiring to me, and several years after the curves class,
  when I am admiring my hand dyed fabrics, your words are still ringing in my
  ears to 'cut up my hand dyes'! Thank you for telling it to me straight and
  generously sharing your skills and warm personality. Your graciousness has
  created beauty in my world and my heart.
