  Thank you so much for doing this tutorial.  Not only is it a blessing to know
  how you accomplish your beautiful work, but to open your heart and soul into
  sharing your talent with others is paying it forward to all of us.  It now
  lies with each of us to continue sharing our talents, as well.  Your
  generosity will live on in many other areas.  Thank you again.  Nancy
