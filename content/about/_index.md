artistquote: I listen to my mood and work with it allowing the design to evolve spontaneously
  until I am satisfied with the result
artistname: Hilde Van de Walle Morin
artiststatement: Drama and flow is what I like to represent in my fiber work.  I
  find inspiration in both, natural and in architectural scenes, having a particular
  interest in weathered structures and formations.  I enjoy extremes, neutral and
  vivid colors, clean and cluttered lines, chaotic and planned compositions.  In my
  natural scenes I represent reality by simplifying or suggesting it through either
  abstract or primitive designs and through the use of curved piecing techniques.  In
  my cities and villages I strive to portray the energy of the place through the use
  strong compositions.  My approach includes the creation of a first layer of improvised
  pieced fabric with the addition of a second layer of texture through extensive thread
  work and surface design.  My work is influenced by travels, nature walks and by
  my multi-cultural background.<br><br> I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. Of Belgian
  descent, I currently reside in Portland, Oregon, USA. I exhibit at local and international
  venues including SOFA (Sculptured Objects and Functional Art) Chicago and New York,
  Museum of the Americas-Florida, Galería Exágono-México, CIART (Centro Integral de
  Arte Textil) in Argentina, Museum of Contemporary Craft in Portland-Oregon, Oregon
  Historical Society Museum in Portland, Oregon and Visions Art Museum in San Diego,
  California.<br><br>I teach regularly at <a href="/studio/">my
  studio</a> and at other venues, promoting the use of free form techniques in the
  construction of art quilts.
