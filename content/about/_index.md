  I listen to my mood and work with it allowing the design to evolve
  spontaneously until I am satisfied with the result
artistname: Hilde Van de Walle Morin
artiststatement: >-
  Drama and flow is what I like to express in my fiber work.  “Drama” in the
  form of chaotic lines and weathered surfaces, and “flow” through the use of
  curved elements and color gradations. My work is influenced by travels, nature
  walks and by my multi-cultural background and is mainly inspired by nature and
  by architectural scenes. I try to find a place between abstract and realism,
  and use an improvisational approach in the design process allowing my work to
  evolve spontaneously. My construction technique includes the creation of a
  first layer of pieced fabric with the addition of a second layer of texture
  through extensive thread work and surface design.  <br><br> Born in
  Caracas-Venezuela, of Belgian descent, I currently reside in Portland, Oregon,
  USA. I exhibit at local and international venues including SOFA (Sculptured
  Objects and Functional Art) Chicago and New York, Museum of the
  Americas-Florida, Galería Exágono-México, CIART (Centro Integral de Arte
  Textil) in Argentina, Museum of Contemporary Craft in Portland-Oregon, Oregon
  Historical Society Museum in Portland, Oregon and Visions Art Museum in San
  Diego, California.<br><br>I teach regularly at <a href="/studio/">my
  studio</a> and at other venues, promoting the use of free form techniques in
  the construction of art quilts.
