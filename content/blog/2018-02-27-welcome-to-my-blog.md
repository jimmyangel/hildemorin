For years I’ve been pondering with the idea of maintaining a blog but the commitment of having to post on a regular basis did not appeal to me.  Instead, I have maintained an online presence through my fiber art Facebook and Instagram pages and my website.

_So here I am with my blog!_  My intention is to be all-inclusive, everyone can read my posts, facebook and non-facebook readers, Instagram and non-Instagram fans, students, followers from afar who cannot travel to take a class and visitors who just want to see what’s happening here.  

I will keep the content strictly (with maybe a few exceptions) fiber related, posts may be weekly or monthly but certainly not daily and I encourage you to drop me a note so I know you exist.  This is the place where I plan to share techniques, conduct demos, show class and student work, post progress on my own work and announce exhibitions and other events.  Of course, you can always follow me on fb and Instagram.

Stay tuned … the next post will be about making Fiber Bowls.
