**Section 4 – Finish Edges and Stitch**

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/uploads/blog-bowls-tutorial-12.jpg">

Now onto finishing the edge of the bowl:  after applying fusible web to the fabric you’ll be using for this, cut a few strips about ¾” wide and altogether long enough to cover the entire circumference of your bowl.  I didn’t cut them on the bias because I didn’t have enough fabric…it was just a bit trickier but it worked.

Fold the strips in half lengthwise to create a crease. While giving it a slight pull, carefully fuse it to the outer edge of your bowl using the crease as your guide for where to fold to the back of your bowl.

Fold strip to the back of the bowl and fuse.  Do this until the entire edge is covered.

Your bowl is now ready for stitching.  Select coordinating (or not) threads and setup your machine.  I tend to use polyester (but pretty much anything works, just experiment and discover what your machine handles best) on the top and bottom (bobbin.) Sometimes I use invisible thread (Madera) in the bobbin to get a uniform look in the back and avoid any bobbin thread showing on the inside of my bowl.

Starting either at the outer edge or center of your bowl, sew round and round and spiral your way in and out of the bowl several times. 

The more stitching, the stiffer a bowl you get.  This works best with a glass of wine in your other hand!

Remember that your bowl is flexible, you may need to fold it depending on the throat size of your machine.

The center of your bowl is the trickiest to reach, do this very slowly (and fold your bowl if needed.)

Finished!

I’ve shown you the easiest way to stitch your bowl and I highly recommend you start there, but after you feel comfortable with the way your machine handles all those layers, I encourage you to try other stitching…free motion can be fun on a bowl!

_You are now ready to play and experiment on your own!  Have fun and if you’d like to take this a step further, come to one of my Bowl classes where we work on more complex designs, explore different shapes and finishes, and even cut holes through our bowls!  Classes are posted on my [calendar](https://www.hildemorin.com/calendar/) or you can [contact me](https://www.hildemorin.com/#contact)._
