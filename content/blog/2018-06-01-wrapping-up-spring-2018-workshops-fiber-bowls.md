**May – Bowls at Quilt Gallery in Kalispell, MT and Eugene, OR**

Bowls, Art Bowls, Quilt in a Bowl, Fiber Bowls, Fabric Bowls, however we call them they are three dimensional fiber works in the shape of a bowl varying from 14” to 18” in diameter.  

We start with a base of heavy-duty canvas and fuse layers of fabric in a pleasing design.  This fusing is temporary as we then sew through all of the layers, canvas included, to hold it all together.

Here are some of the very clever and diverse designs that the ladies from Kalispell and Eugene’s Emerald Valley Quilters created, from left to right, top to bottom: Deb1, Deb2, Sheila, Shari, Joan, Susan, Martha, Sigrid, Belinda. These are only a few,  some are finished and some are almost there! I always enjoy finding out how and where everyone finds their inspiration.

Thank you everyone for joining me in these sewing adventures, your enthusiasm and watching you create is what makes these teaching experiences fun!  Thanks also for letting me share your work with others.

This marks the end of the Spring workshops after which we spent a few days at the coast to relax and recharge.
