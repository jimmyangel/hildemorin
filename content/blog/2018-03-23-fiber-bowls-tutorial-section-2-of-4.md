Thank you for all your visits, comments, questions, encouragement and good wishes. I can feel the pressure!

One very important question I received: _"What are we aiming for?"_  Answer: This is our goal:

Another question made me laugh: "_Are you going to continue the instructions this month or is it going to be one step a month?"_  Answer: LOL

Section 2– Shape Bowl

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/uploads/blog-bowls-tutorial-4.jpg">

Using a chalk (or erasable) pencil, mark the center of your bowl.  Draw an inner circle around the center.  This will be the part of your bowl that sits flat on the table; the larger the circle, the more stable your bowl.  I used a 6 inches diameter circle.  Mark 8 lines that divide your bowl in 8 equal size sections.

Using these lines, cut ½ inch wide wedges that start at the edge of your canvas circle and end in a point at the edge of your chalk inner circle.

Notice that the ½ inch wedge uses the line as center, thus measuring ¼ inch on each side of it.

Pull the wedge out and proceed to cutting the next one.

It is very important that the wedges end in a point.

You end up with 8 cut wedges.

Using your zigzag foot and both hands (this is where it got tricky for me to hold my camera) starting at the point of your wedge, get ready to zigzag your way to the outside of your bowl.

Use a wide and short zigzag stitch (I set it to a 4-5 inches width and 1 to 1 ½ inches length)

Sew from the point of your wedge to the edge of the bowl making sure the zig falls on the left and the zag falls on the right side of your wedge, pushing it closed.  If the stitching is not nice and even, don’t worry because this will all get covered up later.

Do the zigzag stitching on all 8 wedges and you have a shaped bowl.

The outside shows the 8 zigzag lines too.

Give your bowl a bit more heat with the iron to re-fuse anything that may have gotten loose.  It is OK if things don’t fuse 100% because this is temporary.  The stitching at the end is what holds it all together.

I’ll be back in a few with Section 3.  Have fun!
