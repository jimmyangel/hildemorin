Yes, my quilt goes to the Oregon Coast to be part of the Seaside Civic & Convention  (INSERT LINK) Center’s (SCCC) permanent public art collection.

In September 2021 I received a short and sweet message from Drea Frost asking if I was taking commissions.  She was working on a project for the SCCC as a curator of their permanent public art collection.

How could I say “no” to this! 

Drea invited me to meet with her, with the General Manager, Russ Vandenberg, and with the rest of the committee responsible for the project, and to look at the space where my work would hang.  I was in awe with the newly expanded and renovated facility and felt slightly intimidated by the task ahead of me.  More importantly I felt deeply honored that my work had been chosen to be part of this collection.

A month later I had a contract in my hands and the task to create the largest quilt I have created to date: a triptych with a forest theme, measuring a total of nine feet in width and 4 feet in height, to be delivered in six months.

As usual, the design concept immediately started to evolve in my head and since the designated space for the quilt was at the entrance of the SCCC, I knew that I wanted to evoke an invitation to come in, an invitation to look …

And so the work began ... I did a little bit of doodling and came up with these not-very-fancy sketches that guided me during the design and construction phases.
