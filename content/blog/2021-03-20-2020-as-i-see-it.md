Every year our [MIX group](http://mixpdx.blogspot.com/) comes up with a theme for an exhibit in Portland.  These exhibits then travel to other venues throughout the years.  The theme for 2021 is “As I See It” and you can add anything you’d like to that phrase, before or after. 

I decided on the title and theme “2020 – As I See It”

The year 2020 was a year of isolation, confusion, helplessness and pain, a year we do not want to repeat but also a year we should not forget.

I made this quilt with the pandemic in mind, thinking of its effects on the world and on each and every one of us.  It is a quilt that I will keep for myself as a reminder to not take anybody or anything for granted.

My process:

I love to create architectural quilts of places that make a strong impact on me.  I also learned new skills last year, inside and outside of my studio.  Inside my studio, I learned to inset circles! I tried just about every technique I found in books, YouTube and in blogs, and when I finally settled for the one that worked for me I made many blocks that ended up in a large children’s quilt. 

I was also ready to start my “2020 – As I See It” quilt, with measurement requirements of 18”w x 40”h

So, I decided that I wanted to create a world in isolation, places in a bubble.  The 18x40 measurements were a challenge that made the placement of those bubbles a bit tricky but then I also discovered that they could fall off the quilt, and half or partial circles were ok.  The next task was to decide which places were going in the bubbles and I went back and forth a million times, finally settling for Portland-OR, a street in France, La Boca-Argentina and a village in Venezuela.  I started with a few simple sketches mainly for size and proportions.

The street in France was my first attempt followed by a grouping of houses in La Boca.  Once they were pieced, I either folded or used paper templates to audition the design.

Next came Portland, a view of the city from the Ross Island bridge going from East to West, with the Tilikum Crossing bridge in the foreground.  I knew I wanted to include the Koin Tower because of its interesting shape, and Big Pink.  A fabric that I created during a [Resist](https://www.stitchindye.com/workshops-2/r-e-s-i-s-t-creating-pattern-with-wax) workshop with [A Stitch in Dye](https://www.stitchindye.com/) was a perfect candidate for a yellow building.

For the Tilikum Crossing I had in mind couching a few white strings over Portland, later.  Next, came a village in Venezuela with whitish houses and colorful windows.  But as I finished it and auditioned the entire piece, something didn’t seem right.  After staring at it for some time I decided that France was lacking the playfulness that the other bubbles had, it was too serious.  After playing a bit I decided to send France home and bring in Portugal with the city of Porto.

The colors and shapes looked much better!

Now that I had the places built, it was time to inset them in circles.  I chose one large piece of fabric and proceeded to insert every circle, or half circle using a combination of the methods by described in [Marie Joerger's Circle Tutorial ](http://mariescreativespace.blogspot.com/2014/05/nhmqg-bom-plus-circle-tutorial.html)and in a book by Dale Fleming called Pieced Curves So Simple.

The cities/villages are slightly tilted to represent the confusion during most of the year and many times contradicting “best practices” put in place by health organizations all over the world.

I usually decide on the quilting while I am piecing and I knew that this one required every circle to have its own quilting and then something that connected them all.  My initial plan was to quilt houses in the background but I realized that there wasn’t enough space for this and it would have been way to busy. So I settled for matchstick quilting with dark thread, representing the many modes of communication during this past year: Zoom, Whatsapp, Google Meet, Hangout, messaging, Signal, Telegram … and so many more!

The little circles you see floating in between are a special request from our daughter, the scientist, who researches Viruses at OHSU and has kept us up-to-date with developments.  They represent COronVIrusDisease-2019.

Here is my final piece, "2020-As I See It

2021 is looking promising as we slowly come out of our caves and start rebuilding lives and places.  We (my husband and I) look forward to re-establish our Tuesday-with-the-grandkids day soon and I am dying to teach face-to-face workshops again.
