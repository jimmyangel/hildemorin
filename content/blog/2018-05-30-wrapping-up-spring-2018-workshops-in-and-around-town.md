**April - Empty Spools Seminars**

Spring Classes started with Empty Spools Seminars, where I taught a 5-day In And Around Town workshop at Asilomar in Pacific Grove, CA.   

City scapes, street scapes, villages, neighborhoods, castles, houses, barns, doors, windows, anything that has a dwelling or part of it serves as inspiration for this workshop and this year we even had historic water tanks!  Some of the places we visited were Portugal, San Francisco, Italy … several times, Chicago, Ireland, Arizona, Greece, New Mexico, and some stayed in California.

 All these works are pieced … we make lace for embellishing … we discharge fabrics to create weathered looks … we work hard … we share … we enjoy our time together as a group.

This was our large classroom with plenty of room to spread out, and we did spread out! The community scrap pile in the center of the room came in very handy for that bit of yellow we needed or for that special treasure that was someone else’s discard.

Here is a peek at Allison’s Portugal scene, Nikki’s Italy in San Francisco and Susan’s Fairy Tale.  These are sections of their work…

Of course, there is always time to wander the beaches of this beautiful place.
