**May â€“ Quilt Gallery in Kalispell, MT**

Next stop was Kalispell, Montana where Quilt Gallery invited me to teach a longer version (5 days) of my Curves & More workshop.  Pollen was at its peak and my lungs felt it! 

A very enthusiastic group of students created beautiful work through the use of free form curved piecing techniques.  There were no plans, no sketches, no drawings, just lots of fabric to cut into and piece back together!

We piece curves, skinny ... very skinny lines, make and insert solvy lace, assemble asymmetrical circles, add 3D flanges, all using an improvisational approach.

Here are a few sample works, from top to bottom and left to right, the works of: Leslie, Brooke, Regina, Bobbie, Leann, Darlene and Noranne.

As usual, there was a little time to enjoy the scenery, including a quick detour to Glacier National Park (thanks to my hostess Joan) and a huckleberry shake on my way back, in St. Regis, MT.
