Lately, I have been a bit out of touch with the quilting world and friends, however, I have been quietly working in my studio on a few new Walls and Windows creations.  They are still in progress but I’d like to show you one of these as I am enjoying the process and the piecing challenge.

The streets of Europe are a great inspiration for someone who loves walls, windows and streets.  Inspired by a photo of a street in the city of Lourdes, France, I played around with Prisma, a phone App that allows you to edit photos and create very interesting photo effects, here are a few.  On the left is the original photo and then three modifications.

All interesting variations, but the one that caught my eye is the last one on the right, specifically the introduction of the bright colors yellow, orange and red.  

Ready to start! For a few seconds I hesitated whether piecing or paper piecing this project but I very quickly realized that using improvisational piecing techniques would make the process much more enjoyable.  I also wanted a softer look, so no black skinny lines (although they would have been fun to piece!)

First thing was to make a large black and white print to help me with the scale and determining which lines are important. Next, onto the piecing of the back wall and the windows.  I had to iron many seams open to reduce bulk.  The challenge was to figure out which lines are important to keep the essence of the image.

Piecing is done … now the quilting.  I decided on doing this in two layers…layer 1 is a horizontal matchstick quilting all over the piece, from top to bottom.  Layer 2 vertical lines highlighting the three main walls, left, right and back.   It is so stiff, it feels like cardboard! ☺  It measures 30”W x 48”H and has no name yet.

As soon as I finish the facing and figure out a name for this piece, I’ll photograph it professionally and post in my gallery.  If you’d like to see this piece in person, it will be exhibited as part of my small solo show “If Walls Could Talk” from July to September 2019 at the [Visions Art Museum](https://www.visionsartmuseum.org/).

To end, I want to dedicate a line to my Mom and her skill as a fashion designer and seamstress.  These are pictures of some of her designs and drawings from when she attended fashion design school in Belgium during WWII.   She then sewed her designs using paper since it was difficult to get a hold of fabric during the war years.

And some pages from her notebook …

Mom passed away three weeks ago, on January 2 at age 92 in Venezuela, where she lived since 1950.  In my eyes she was an optimist, and this always kept her young.
