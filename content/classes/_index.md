  - namekey: curves
    title: CURVES & MORE
    duration: 2-3 days
    description: >
      Learn the art of piecing free form curves without pinning, marking

      or clipping.  Add interest by incorporating multi-directional and 3 dimensional

      elements.  Create your own lace and learn to insert it into your quilt.  Embellish

      your work with yarns and threads of  different weights. Finish off your piece

      using a clean and elegant facing technique. You will piece, quilt, embellish and

      face your quilt in class.


      Size of finished work is approximately 20" x 20".

  - namekey: yourownforest
    title: YOUR OWN FOREST
    is-new: true
    duration: 3-5 days
    description: >
      Inspired by a photograph, sketch or mental image, create your own abstract

      or representational forest scene using free-form and curve-piecing techniques.

      Study light and shadows and achieve depth by playing with shapes and color gradations.


      This class builds upon my beginners CURVES AND MORE class, taking the curved piecing

      to the next level where we create multiple curved sections and join them into

      one coherent piece, your own forest.

  - namekey: cityscape
    title: CITYSCAPE (IN AND AROUND TOWN)
    duration: 3-5 days
    description: >
      Collect the essence of a favorite place based on your own impressions.

      Design and create your own vision of a town, neighborhood, village, cityscape

      or skyline … detect common visual elements, highlight details, create building

      blocks and put them all together using improvisational piecing techniques.


      Add character to your town by experimenting with different surface design techniques

      (add texture, discharge color, incorporate 3D elements). Consider creating an

      irregularly shaped piece and finish off your work with an elegant facing technique.


      Recommended size of work is 36” or less on each side.

  - title: ABSTRACTING WITH CURVES AND CIRCLES
    duration: 5 days
    description: >-
      Curves make an image easy to look at.  They lead the viewer’s eye through
      the entire piece, almost as if they where pointing the way.  Curves are
      rhythmic, graceful and add energy. They can separate or connect sections
      and add balance.  That’s what this class is all about, designing and
      creating your own abstract piece using free-form curves and circles.  


      This class builds upon my basic CURVES AND MORE class, which focuses on techniques to create one single section of curves.  In ABSTRACTING WITH CURVES AND CIRCLES we will create multiple curved sections and then join them into one coherent design.

    title: BOWL ART
    duration: 2-3 days
    description: >
      Create a three dimensional art piece in the shape of a bowl. Starting

      with heavy duck canvas, you will shape a bowl and then decorate with your own

      design and embellishments.
