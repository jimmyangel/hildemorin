    Learn the art of piecing free form curves without pinning, marking
    or clipping.  Add interest by incorporating multi-directional and 3 dimensional
    elements.  Create your own lace and learn to insert it into your quilt.  Embellish
    your work with yarns and threads of  different weights. Finish off your piece
    using a clean and elegant facing technique. You will piece, quilt, embellish and
    face your quilt in class.

- namekey: yourownforest
  title: YOUR OWN FOREST
  is-new: true
  duration: 3-5 days
  description: |
    Inspired by a photograph, sketch or mental image, create your own abstract
    or representational forest scene using free-form and curve-piecing techniques.
    Study light and shadows and achieve depth by playing with shapes and color gradations.

    This class builds upon my beginners CURVES AND MORE class, taking the curved piecing
    to the next level where we create multiple curved sections and join them into
    one coherent piece, your own forest.

- namekey: yourownvillage
  title: YOUR OWN VILLAGE
  duration: 3-5 days
  description: |
    Design and create your own village. Learn improvisational piecing techniques
    to create huts, houses and curved landscapes.   Learn to put it all together into
    a free form landscape quilt.

    You will exercise strip and curved piecing
    techniques to create individual quilt units; design your own quilt diagram and
    put it all together through improvisational piecing techniques.

    Size of finished class work varies, I recommend 36”x36” or 40”x20” or 20”x40”
    approximately.

- namekey: cityscape
  title: CITYSCAPE (IN AND AROUND TOWN)
  duration: 3-5 days
  description: |
    Collect the essence of a favorite place based on your own impressions.
    Design and create your own vision of a town, neighborhood, village, cityscape
    or skyline … detect common visual elements, highlight details, create building
    blocks and put them all together using improvisational piecing techniques.

    Add character to your town by experimenting with different surface design techniques
    (add texture, discharge color, incorporate 3D elements). Consider creating an
    irregularly shaped piece and finish off your work with an elegant facing technique.

    Recommended size of work is 36” or less on each side.

  title: FRACTURED BLOCKS
  duration: 2-3 days
  description: |
    Based on a traditional pattern, the log cabin, you will create this
    contemporary-looking quilt by bending the rules of this well known block.

    Once you have created several of these “untraditional” log cabin blocks you will be
    challenged to cut through them to achieve some very interesting and abstract designs.
    Bubbles included!

    Skills covered in this class include straight and curve machine
    piecing.
